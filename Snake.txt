The objective of this server-client game is to move the snake around the frame and eat the dots. The more dots you eat, the bigger the snake gets. There are two files: Server and Client.
The Server file will be run on the webserver and its IP address will be shared to the clients. The client file will be run on client computers. 
The server will receive the score from the clients and will store it in a dictionary. It will sort the result and will inform the client about the highest score in the game.
